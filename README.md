# FinalProject-AndelaBootCamp
This is the repository for the final project of the Andela Boot Camp

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if they choose to opt in. When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only. In this exercise you will be required to digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.

CONSTRAINTS
The Dojo has rooms, which can be offices or living spaces. An office can accommodate a maximum of 6 people. A living space can accommodate a maximum of 4 people.

A person to be allocated could be a fellow or staff. Staff cannot be allocated living spaces. Fellows have a choice to choose a living space or not.

This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.

**Capitalised attributes are fixed attributes in the class
**Small lettered attributes are the ones passed into the class during initiation
